        <h2 style="margin: 10px;">What is Cancer?

            Cancer is a broad term for diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. These cells can invade nearby tissues and, in some cases, spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymphatic systems.
            
            <br><br>Types of Cancer
            There are more than 100 types of cancer, but they are generally classified into five main categories:
            
            <br>1. Carcinomas Cancers that begin in the skin or tissues that line internal organs (e.g., lung, breast, colon cancer).
            <br>2. Sarcomas Cancers that develop in bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, or other connective tissues.
            <br>3. Leukemia: Cancers of the blood and bone marrow.
            <br>4. Lymphomas: Cancers of the immune system tissues.
            <br>5. Central Nervous System Cancers Cancers that begin in the brain and spinal cord.
            
            <br><br>Causes of Cancer
            Cancer can be caused by genetic mutations or exposure to certain environmental factors, including:
            
            <br>- Tobacco: Smoking or chewing tobacco is a major cause of cancers, especially lung, throat, and mouth cancers.
            <br> - Radiation: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or artificial sources like tanning beds can cause skin cancers.
            <br>  - Chemicals: Exposure to certain chemicals and carcinogens (like asbestos or benzene) can increase cancer risk.
            <br>  - Viruses and Infections: Certain viruses, such as HPV (human papillomavirus) and Hepatitis B, are linked to cancers like cervical and liver cancer.
            <br> - Genetics: Some cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancer, have a hereditary component due to genetic mutations passed down through families.
            
            <br><br> Symptoms of Cancer
            The symptoms of cancer depend on its type and location, but general signs may include:
            
            <br>  - Unexplained weight loss
            <br>  - Fatigue
            <br>  - Persistent cough or difficulty breathing
            <br>  - Unusual lumps or swelling
            <br> - Changes in bowel or bladder habits
            <br> - Skin changes (new moles, changes in existing moles)
            <br> - Pain, especially if it is persistent and unexplained
            
            <br><br>Stages of Cancer
            Cancers are often classified into stages, which indicate the extent of the disease:
            
            <br>  - Stage 0: Abnormal cells are present but haven't spread (in situ).
            <br>  - Stage I: Cancer is small and has not spread beyond its original location.
            <br>  - Stage II & III: Cancer is larger and may have spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes.
            <br>  - Stage IV: Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body (metastasis).
            
            <br><br>Treatment Options
            Treatment for cancer varies based on its type and stage. Common treatments include:
            
            <br>  - Surgery: Removal of the tumor or cancerous tissue.
            <br>  - Radiation Therapy: Using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells or shrink tumors.
            <br>  - Chemotherapy: Using drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells.
            <br>  - Immunotherapy: Boosting the immune system to better target cancer cells.
            <br>  - Targeted Therapy: Drugs that specifically target cancer cell mutations.
            <br> - Hormone Therapy: For cancers like breast or prostate cancer, this therapy blocks the hormones that fuel cancer growth.
    
            <br><br>Prevention
            While not all cancers can be prevented, reducing risk factors and early detection can lower the chance of developing cancer or increase the effectiveness of treatment:
            
            <br>  - Avoid tobacco use.
            <br>  - Protect skin from UV radiation.
            <br> - Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables.
            <br> - Exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight.
            <br> - Get vaccinated against viruses like HPV and Hepatitis B.
            <br> - Undergo regular screenings for cancers (e.g., mammograms, colonoscopies, pap smears) based on your age and risk factors.
